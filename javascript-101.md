## Exercise 1

```js 

// Example of in-line

/* This is en example for multi-line comment */
```

## Exercise 2 - Variables

```js 

/*  In computer science, data is anything that is meaningful to the computer. 
JavaScript provides seven different data types which are undefined,
null, boolean, string, symbol, number, and object. 

For example, computers distinguish between numbers, such as the number 12, 
and strings, such as "12", "dog", or "123 cats", which are collections of characters. 
Computers can perform mathematical operations on a number, but not on a string.

Variables allow computers to store and manipulate data in a dynamic fashion. 
They do this by using a "label" to point to the data rather than using the data itself. 
Any of the seven data types may be stored in a variable. */

// Example

var myName;

```
## Exercise 3 - Storing Values with the Assignment Operator

```js


var a = 7;
var b = a;


```
## Exercise 4 - Initializing Variables with the Assignment Operator

```js

/* Eg : 

It is common to initialize a variable to an initial value in the same line as it is declared.

var myVar = 0;

Creates a new variable called myVar and assigns it an initial value of 0.

*/ 

var a = 9;

```

## Exercise 5 - Understanding Uninitialized Variables

```js

/*NaN means Not a Number  

When JavaScript variables are declared, they have an initial value of undefined. If you do a mathematical operation on an undefined variable your result will be NaN which means "Not a Number". If you concatenate a string with an undefined variable, you will get a literal string of "undefined".

*/
Assignment: a should be 6, b should be 15, c should be "I am a String"

// Initialize these three variables
var a = 5;
var b = 10;
var c = "I am a";

// Do not change code below this line
a = a + 1;
b = b + 5;
c = c + " String!";


```
