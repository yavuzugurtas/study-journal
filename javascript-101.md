## Exercise 2

```js 

/*  In computer science, data is anything that is meaningful to the computer. 
JavaScript provides seven different data types which are undefined,
null, boolean, string, symbol, number, and object. 

For example, computers distinguish between numbers, such as the number 12, 
and strings, such as "12", "dog", or "123 cats", which are collections of characters. 
Computers can perform mathematical operations on a number, but not on a string.

Variables allow computers to store and manipulate data in a dynamic fashion. 
They do this by using a "label" to point to the data rather than using the data itself. 
Any of the seven data types may be stored in a variable. */

// Example

var myName;
